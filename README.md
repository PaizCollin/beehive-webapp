Beehive Monitor Web Application
This full stack web application (MERN Stack), was built to service a Santa Clara University Senior Design engineering project

Installation
In the main directory, run `npm install` to install backend dependencies. In the `frontend` directory, run `npm install` to install frontend dependencies. Be sure to install Express and Node on your development machines.

Configuration
Use the template `.env` file to setup necessary configurations such as the MongoDB URI, JWT secret, Google Maps Locations API, and port.

Usage
In the main director, run `npm run dev` to run both the frontend and backend. run `npm run server` to run only the backend, or run `run npm client` to run only the frontend. The frontend will run on port 3000, and the backend will run on port 5000., by default.
